## 1. Data Cleansing Steps

In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the data_mart schema named clean_weekly_sales:

* Convert the week_date to a DATE format
* Add a week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from  
  the   1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
* Add a month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column
* Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
* Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value

* Add a new demographic column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values:

![Question6](images/DataMart_DataCleansing2.png)

* Ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the new age_band and demographic columns

* Generate a new avg_transaction column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

```sql
CREATE TABLE data_mart.clean_weekly_sales AS 
(
   SELECT
      to_date(week_date, 'dd-mm-yyyy') AS DATE,
      date_part('month', to_date(week_date, 'dd-mm-yyyy')) AS week_month,
      date_part('year', to_date(week_date, 'dd-mm-yyyy')) AS week_year,
      region,
      platform,
      segment,
      CASE
         WHEN
            RIGHT(segment, 1) = '1' 
         THEN
            'Young Adults' 
         WHEN
            RIGHT(segment, 1) = '2' 
         THEN
            'Middle Age' 
         WHEN
            RIGHT(segment, 1) = '3' 
            OR RIGHT(segment, 1) = '4' 
         THEN
            'Retirees' 
         ELSE
            'Unknown' 
      END
      AS age_band, 
      CASE
         WHEN
            LEFT(segment, 1) = 'C' 
         THEN
            'Couples' 
         WHEN
            LEFT(segment, 1) = 'F' 
         THEN
            'Families' 
         ELSE
            'Unknown' 
      END
      AS demographic, customer_type, round((sales / transactions), 2) AS avg_transaction 
   FROM
      data_mart.weekly_sales 
)
;
SELECT
   * 
FROM
   data_mart.clean_weekly_sales LIMIT 10
```

## 2. Data Exploration

### 1. What day of the week is used for each week_date value?

```sql

```

### 2. What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?

```sql

```

### 3. How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?

```sql

```

### 4. What is the total sales for each region for each month?

```sql

```

### 5. What is the total count of transactions for each platform?

```sql

```

### 6. What is the percentage of sales for Retail vs Shopify for each month?

```sql

```

### 7. What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?

```sql

```

### 8. Which age_band and demographic values contribute the most to Retail sales?

```sql

```

### 9. Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?

```sql

```

## 3. Before & After Analysis

This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.

Taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.

We would include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before

Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:

### 1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?

```sql

```

### 2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?

```sql

```

### 3. How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?

```sql

```

## 4. Bonus Question

### 1. Which areas of the business have the highest negative impact in sales metrics performance in 2020 for the 12 week before and after period?

* region
* platform
* age_band
* demographic
* customer_type

*Do you have any further recommendations for Dannyâ€™s team at Data Mart or any interesting insights based off this analysis?*
